# Point to Point Protocol

This repository aims to implement Point to Point Protocol (PPP, [RFC1661](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1661)) in modern C.

This repository does not aim to implement all standardized network control protocols (NCPs) available to PPP, due to the numerous obsolete NCPs. Implementation will focus on more common, or more interesting NCPs first.

## ⚠️ Not production ready

This repository is in the early, pre-release stage of development. It is not suitable for production use, anything may change at any time, and may be broken.
